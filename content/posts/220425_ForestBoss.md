This was orignally meant to be my submission for a course on video game music I took on the side this semester. I ended up getting to do a collaboration with a great dev team and produce music for an actual game, but I didn't want to abandon this one. So, it gets to be the first entry in my "This Game Does Not Exist" collection of game-inspired but as yet un-play-tested music!

The vibe is "stumbling across a boss of some sort in a Zelda-esque action-adventure game". Listen below!
