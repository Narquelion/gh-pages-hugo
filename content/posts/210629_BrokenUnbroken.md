This was the first thing I seriously made in Ableton. I've fiddled around with it a bit since I first finished it, but I mostly haven't changed it from how it was at the time. My coffee scale broke on the day I started working on this, then somehow fixed itself on the day I finished it, hence the title! Yes, it's not any deeper than that.
