This is the second track in my "This Game Does Not Exist" collection, and also the first of my "morning sprints", where I try to spend an hour in the morning developing some new idea. Of course, the polishing took longer than an hour, but all in all, this is more of a proof-of-concept than what I would call a full-fledged track: A quick idea to get something out there (which is what matters)!

The track features some recordings I had made for some (ultimately unused) SFX for [No Splotch Gallery](/posts/220419_NoSplotch.html). It also features some sounds made with a borrowed MicroFreak (added later), which I'm looking forward to playing with some more. :)

The vibe is "exploring a spaceship (or perhaps some kind of alien planet) that is supposed to be deserted, and definitely _not_ hearing any footsteps behind you". The file was (and still is) titled "KajiuraMetroid" while I was working on it; can you see why?
