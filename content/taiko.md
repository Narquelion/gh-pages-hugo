### What is kumidaiko?

_Kumidaiko_ is the modern art of _taiko_ (Japanese drum) ensemble, in which a group of players use various percussion (and melodic) instruments to create music and foster community.

### What do you do?

I drum with [Godaiko Drummers](https://michigantaiko.net/performances), [Sakura Japanese Instrumental Group](https://www.facebook.com/SakuraPerformanceGroup), and the [Great Lakes Taiko Center Collective](https://michigantaiko.net). Previously, I lead the University of Chicago's taiko ensemble, Koj≈ç Daiko.

### Where can I learn more?

There are taiko groups all over the U.S., and many offer lessons! Here in Michigan, classes and activities are availabe through the [Great Lakes Taiko Center](https://michigantaiko.net).

I am also available to provide private instruction virtually or in-person. Send me an email at mathew AT mathewkramer.io and we can set something up!
