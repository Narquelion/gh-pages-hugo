# **What I Do**

I am a fourth-year in the linguistics department at the University of Michigan. I'm a member of [Dr. Savithry Namboodiripad's](http://savi.ling.lsa.umich.edu/) [Contact, Cognition and Change Lab](https://github.com/ccc-lab).

My research investigates the interaction between cognitive processes and social  factors, how this interaction contributes to long-term language change (particularly morphosyntactic change), and what contact-induced change can tell us about speakers' linguistic representations and the processes underlying the emergence of cross-linguistic patterns. I am especially interested in the application of computational modeling to questions in language contact, and in how these models can incorporate findings from various subfields to produce a coherent picture of language change in individuals and groups.
